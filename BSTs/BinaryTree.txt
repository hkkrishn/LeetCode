A Binary Tree

Each Node can only have 0,1 or 2 nodes
Each child can only have one parent
Each Node represents a certain state

Binary tree creation

const BinaryTreeNode(val)=>{
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
}

Perfect/Balanced Binary Trees are desirable
the number of total nodes at each level doubles as we go to the next layer
The number of nodes on the last level =
Sum(all the nodes) +1

Half of the nodes are the on the last level

O(log N)

A Special Characteristic or property of binary tree

Level:0 2^level = 1
level 1 : 2^1 = 2
level 2: 2^2 = 4
level 3 : 2^ 3 = 8

# of nodes in a tree  = 2^h -1
log(nodes) = height

O(log(N))
