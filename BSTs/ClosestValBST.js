//Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree and a target interger value and returns the closest value to that target value in the BST
//YOu can assuem that there will only be one Closest Value
//Each BST node has an interger value and a left child node and a right child node, A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
//its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to every node its right; and its childred nodes are either BST nodes
// or None/null


//Write BST class
