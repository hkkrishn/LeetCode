//Trees are structs that are hierachical in nature
//Trees can have zero or more child nodes
//Every Tree has one root node and every node descends from one node

//The DOM is a tree structure ( Document Object Model)
// Decisions are also based on tree data structure.
//The Abstract Syntax tree uses a tree data structure

//Nodes can contain any information that we want

//Linked Lists are the basis of trees.
