Binary Search Trees
lookup O(logN)
insert O(log N)
delete O (log N)

They are great for comparing things
This data structure preserves relationships

BST rules
1. All child nodes to the right of the root node must be greater than the current node
2. All child Nodes to the left of the root must be less than the current node
3. A Node can only have upto two children


Balanced vs UnBalanced Search Trees

Ideally we want to balance our search Trees


BST Pros and CONS
Pros
Better than O(n)
Ordered - we have sorted hierachical data
Flexible Size

Cons
No O(1) operations
